# MS-ORDERS

> Order management system for a snack bar.


## What I need?

With this structure, your environment will have everything you need to build a project:

- Node, docker and docker-compose
- Kubectl and minikube (to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster)

## Running the application on a local Kubernetes cluster

- `minikube start`: starts the minikube to create a Kubernetes cluster.
- `cd orders-project-clean-architecture`: to be in the project's root directory
- `minikube ip`: get the minikube IP address


Now, you need to set this <b>IP Address</b> on Kubernetes Service (service.yaml) in externalIPs field:

```
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: "http"
    port: 4003
    targetPort: 4003
  externalIPs:
  - your-minikube-ip
  selector:
    app: orders-project
```

 Then you can deploy the application to the cluster:

- `kubectl apply -f deploy/`: apply all configuration files from the deploy folder to the created cluster.
- `kubectl port-forward <name-of-the-pod> 4003:4003`: run the application on your machine using the port 4003.

## Running the application directly on your local machine

You can use these commands to start the application:

- `docker build -t order . --no-cache`
- `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate`

Docker-compose is set to start an instance of Postgres and the entire application.

- `npm run build`: builds app.
- `npm run copy-swagger`: copies swagger to the dist folder.
- `npm run start`: start the server.
- `npm run dev`: start the server in development mode.
## Swagger

http://localhost:4003/docs/

## Local Access - Endpoints Collection

To access the collection, import the "api-requests.postman_collection.json" file at the root of the project in your favorite consumer software

## Project architecture

This project was built using Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.

To separate concerns, the application was built with a Clean Architecture. It is divided into Domain, Application, Infra and Main layers.

### Domain Layer

The Domain layer contains the Entitites and it is in charge of the business logic of the application.

### Application Layer
The Application Layer implements all the use cases and contains the interfaces to interact with the outside world.

### Infra Layer
The Infra Layer contains the controllers, database connections, repositories, that is, this layer has the concrete implementations of the application.


### Main Layer
The Main Layer is the entry point of the application. It contains the framework (Express), the routes, the factory method to inject the necessary dependencies.

## What we use?
